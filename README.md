### Answer any 5 of the following questions. If you complete the required 5, you may answer a 6th question. The best 5 will count towards your final grade. Each question will be worth 5 points. Each question must use one of the following loops: for, while, enumerate.

### Be sure to comment throughout your code! Any question without comments will automatically only be able to receive 3pts.

The Prep Pride store is looking to looking to better market its various products. They have collected information over the last semester that they want to use to help plan their changes for the next semester. Use the following information to answer the questions below: 

*Question 6 is separate and does not use this information.*

```python
prices = [30, 40, 25, 55, 60, 80, 65]
sales = [1, 3, 2, 5, 2, 1, 2]
items = [['tee-shirt','long-sleeved','tanktop'],['quarter-zip','pullover','full-zip',half-zip]]
```

1. Write a program that contains a function that will find the average price of merchandise in the store. This function should iterate through the list `prices` and store the average so it can be returned by the function.

2. Write a program that contains a function that will take the `prices` list as an input, and return the same list `prices`, but with all the prices reduced by `5`.

3. Write a program that contains a function that uses the list `prices` and the list `sales` to calculate how much money the Prep Pride store made last semester. Assume the elements in the `sales` list represent how many sales of each type of item there were, and the elements in the `prices` list represent the cost of each item. *Example: 1 item was sold for $30*

4. Write a program that contains a function that uses the `prices` list to find all the items that cost more than `40`. The cost of these items should be reduced by `10` and the same list `prices` should be returned.

5. Write a program that contains a function that uses the `prices` list and the `items` list. It should return a string the contains the name of the item, followed by a space and the price of it with a $ in front (i.e. "Hoodie $45). The formatting of the original items list needs to remain intact.

6. Write a program that contains a function that helps a user count. The program should prompt the user to enter a number, and then enter if they would like to count by a particular multiple (2, 3, 5, etc.) The number to count to, and the multiple to count by should both be passed to the function. The function should then use a while loop to count to that number by the given multiple. The program should print each number it is counting so the user can follow along in the terminal.
